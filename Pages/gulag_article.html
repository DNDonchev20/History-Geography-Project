        <h1>The Gulag</h1>
        <h3>25 April 1930 - 1960</h3>

        <p>

          The Gulag was the government agency in charge of the Soviet network of forced labor 
          camps set up by order of Vladimir Lenin, reaching its peak during Joseph Stalin's rule
          from the 1930s to the early 1950s. English-language speakers also use the word gulag
          to refer to all forced-labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union, including camps
          that existed in the post-Lenin era. The Gulag is recognized as a major instrument of
          political repression in the Soviet Union. The camps housed a wide range of convicts,
          from petty criminals to political prisoners, large numbers of whom were convicted by 
          simplified procedures, such as by NKVD troikas or by other instruments of extrajudicial
          punishment. In 1918-22, the agency was administered by Cheka, followed by the GPU (1922-23),
          OGPU (1923-34), later by the NKVD (1934-46), and in the final years by the Ministry of 
          Internal Affairs (MVD). The Solovki prison camp, the first corrective labor camp constructed 
          after the revolution, was established in 1918 and legalized by a decree, "On the creation of
          the forced-labor camps", on April 15, 1919. The internment system grew rapidly, reaching a 
          population of 100,000 in the 1920s.

        <p id="extra-text-1" class="hide">
          By the end of 1940, the population of Gulag camps amounted
          to 1.5 million The emergent consensus among scholars is that, of the 14 million prisoners 
          who passed through Gulag camps and the 4 million who passed through Gulag colonies from 1930 to 
          1953, roughly 1.5 to 1.7 million perished there or died soon after their release. Some journalists
          and writers question the reliability of such data and instead rely heavily on memoir sources that come 
          to higher estimations. Archival researchers have found "no plan of destruction" of the gulag population
          and no statement of official intent to kill them, and prisoner releases vastly exceeded the number of 
          deaths in the Gulag. This can be partly attributed to the common practice of releasing prisoners
          who were either suffering from incurable diseases or near death.
