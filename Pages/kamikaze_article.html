          <h1>Kamikaze pilots</h1>
          <h3>Began Oct 1944</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          Kamikaze were a part of the Japanese Special Attack Units of military
          aviators who flew suicide attacks for the Empire of Japan against
          Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of
          World War II, intending to destroy warships more effectively than with
          conventional air attacks. About 3,800 kamikaze pilots died during the
          war, and more than 7,000 naval personnel were killed by kamikaze
          attacks. Kamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive
          missiles, purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft.
          Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what
          was called a "body attack" (tai-atari) in aircraft loaded with bombs,
          torpedoes or other explosives. About 19% of kamikaze attacks were
          successful. The Japanese considered the goal of damaging or sinking
          large numbers of Allied ships to be a just reason for suicide attacks;
          kamikaze was more accurate than conventional attacks and often caused
          more damage. Some kamikazes were still able to hit their targets even
          after their aircraft had been crippled. The attacks began in October
          1944, at a time when the war was looking increasingly bleak for the
          Japanese. They had lost several important battles, many of their best
          pilots had been killed, their aircraft were becoming outdated, and
          they had lost command of the air. Japan was losing pilots faster than
          it could train their replacements, and the nation's industrial
          capacity was diminishing relative to that of the Allies. These
          factors, along with Japan's unwillingness to surrender, led to the use
          of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese
          home islands.
